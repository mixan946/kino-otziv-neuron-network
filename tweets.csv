#PompeiiMovie is amazing! Might name my first born son Milo... On second thought, maybe just my next dog. Yeah that's the same... Right?
Beginning of #PompeiiMovie reminds me of #conan the #barbarian a lot. But sadly no giant snake, just some unrealistic volcano. #disappointed

Writing a B-Movie Bomb review of the #RoboCop remake. I swear, this can serve as an example of remake missteps 101.
Watchin #robocop 1987. Again with the tears. Damn this one way gone too far
Things to love about #Robocop: cast (esp. Michaep Keaton), script, nods to original. Things I disliked: some bad science, Lewis is a man.
#Robocop is a darn good movie. Different focus, more complexity, more character, less broadly satirical than original. Great cast!
I recently watched #Robocop and I have over some time recieved an opinion about the U.S acting like the Worlds police. #MindBlown

Having seen Wolf of Wall St and Dallas Buyers Club, and enjoying them both immensely, I would deffo say McConaughey deserved the Oscar.

"Thought ""Wolf of Wall St"" was the most ""entertaining"" film. So you know the Academy can't pick that one. Would make them appear low brow."
Per @MarkHarrisNYC : American Hustle, Philomena, Nebraska, Cap. Phillips &amp; Wolf of Wall St go combined 0/31 at the Oscars. Gatsby went 2/2.

Cbf watching the Oscars but I don't understand how Leo didn't win, his performance in Wolf of Wall St and Gatsby were incredible
Poor Leo? Yes &amp; no. Yes. I thought his acting Wolf of Wall St. was fantastic. No, as its also a testament to how strong the candidates were!

Dawg. But what about Cate Blanchet in The Monuments Men?
Wait I thought she won for her performance in the Monuments Men
#CateBlanchett was phenomenal in The Monuments Men. Makes me aspire to be that hot and that good at my profession.
Blanchett is solid in everything! Best performance by an actress by far and the best part of monuments men
She wins a Best Actress Oscar and follows it up with a completely ho hum, at BEST, role in The Monuments Men.

The Monuments Men is not as bad as the reviews are making it seem, quite unfair criticism. It's not a classic but certainly is watchable.

@MathWiz97X hes the lead in the new movie need for speed coming out later this month
Ford paid the movie makers of Need For Speed at least like 50 million if not more just to make the new 2014 mustang gt the main car.
I liked the movie Need for Speed when it was called Fast &amp; Furious. #WWE
Only props that will prob be going to the Need for Speed movie, they didn't use CGI. Gotta love real stunts
@WWE arron made the movie need for speed in Macon Georgia.
Idk bout that Need for speed movie coming out. The games are dope prolly not the movie but I hope i'm wrong.

I can not wait for the Need For Speed Movie! #NFSmovie
Is that Kid Cudi in the need for speed movie?
I have a feeling that the Need For Speed movie is gonna be a huge disappointment!
Need For Speed Movie - The Full Length Trailer! http://t.co/I9jW6eQZ18
I would rather watch Rush Limbaugh pick his teeth with a matchbook than the Need for Speed movie.
Why is Kid cudi in need for speed the movie?
@Skibby1225 Actor who plays Jesse Pinkman on Breaking Bad and is in the new Need For Speed movie‚Ä¶ Also, he says ‚ÄúBitch‚Äù a lot.
The last need for speed movie I seen was fast 5
I get soo hype for the next Need For Speed movie
The need for speed video game was sick when I was like 9 but I feel like the movie is gunna suck and have a terrible story line
The only reason I'm going to watch the need for speed movie is because of @aaronpaul_8
i only want to see the need for speed movie because jessies in it
That Need for Speed movie is just a loophole to make more Fast and the Furious movies
So glad Jesse is in the need for speed movie #breakingbadass
Haha Kid Cudi is in the new need for speed movie
the need for speed game is much more better the movie looks like a flop
Omg now Aaron Paul is gonna be in the Need for Speed movie
Aaron Paul looks beautiful in the new Need For Speed movie. üòç
The Need for Speed games tend to be great, but as a movie, how much scope could it have?
"I may have just squealed a bit when the commercial for the Need for Speed movie came on. I'm alone so Erin can't confirm that.

RT @MattCelery: @iamchriscrespo is it me or does the Need for Speed movie look terrible?
@eloy_garcia70 the need for speed movie will be stupid, everything they are doing is a lie Bugatti vs Ford GT and they are both tie. Big lie
Id go see the new Need For Speed movie but it looks like those bullshit fake race movies where they take sharp turns going 220 mph in a city
I don't get the hype about the new need for speed movie. It doesn't look that great.
can't wait for the movie need for speed! @ducidni
Didnt they already make a Need for Speed movie? Havent they already made 7 of them called Fast and the Furious...
@ducidni coming out in Need for speed? That makes the movie 10000x better!
AARON PAUL IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN THE NEW NEED FOR SPEED MOVIE DO YOU HEAR ME SCREAMING

The new Need For Speed movie looks amazing, will definitely be going to see it #NFSMovie
RT @blpratt1982: That Need For Speed movie doesn't look the least bit interesting.
Dude I HAVE to see that Need For Speed movie #NFSMovie
I don't know how I feel about the need for speed movie. :/ it's not like the games.
I have to go see the new Need for Speed movie just because my dude Jesse is in it.
I'm so happy that Jesse from breaking bad is in the new need for speed movie üòçüòç
why are they makin a need for speed movie? guess they never seen the fast and the furious, even though theres like 7 movies
RT @Yo_WillyWonka: Kid Cudi's in the Need For Speed movie
You couldn't pay me to watch this crap Need for Speed movie coming out. Godzilla on the other hand... #RAW
"RT @Taypcb: ‚Äú@AndyRuther:The only way Ill see the new Aaron Paul ""Need for Speed""movie is if he drives high on meth into a Los Pollos Herma‚Ä¶"
The need for speed movie is going to suck
That Need For Speed movie doesn't look the least bit interesting.
I want to watch the new need for speed movie just cause kid cudi is in it
I need to watch need for speed the movie !
Need for speed is my movie I love the cars and I love the one who drive them @aaronpaul_8
I wonder if the need for speed movie going to be any good?
I have no respect for the new Need For Speed movie. #NeedForSpeed
"The Need For Speed movie is gonna suck the biggest amount of c*ck this side of 2017!!

@aaronpaul_8 Can I Somehow Get A Follow ? I Can't Freakin' Wait To See The Need For Speed Movie !!! PLEASE FOLLOW ME !!! #NFSMovie
Need for Speed looks like the worst movie I will ever see yet completely and thoroughly enjoy.
Need for speed movie looks almost as bad as the games but what should I expect the main actor is horrid #NeedForSpeed
@WWE Barron Paul on Wed tonight the movie need for speed was filmed in my home town of Macon,Georgia.ya! !!
This need for speed movie looks terrible. They're way late on the whole high speed car thing. Smh
RT @DJKinney: Aaron Paul is gonna ruin his stock with that Need For Speed movie. Pour man's Fast and the Furious. we still miss Paul Walker.
The Need For Speed Movie looks pretty Sick though
They made a Need for Speed movie? I wasn't aware the Need for Speed games had a plot. #shrug
wwe raw just showed a clip of the need for speed movie and next to kid cudi, these wrestlers looks like oscar-worthy actors
On another note Need for Speed the movie looks like a poor mans fast and furious and that movie sucks as well #RAW
@iamchriscrespo is it me or does the Need for Speed movie look terrible?
Kid Cudi's in the Need For Speed movie
@teneil15 good idea! And we gotta watch the need for speed movie!
"A plug for the new ""Need For Speed"" movie starring Aaron Paul.  You're SURE WWE studios didn't make this film?  #Raw"
The need for speed movie's ending will be paid DLC in theatres. #4CRRAW
I'm not watching need for speed the movie. Fake ass Fast &amp; Furious.
"‚Äú@AndyRuther: The only way I'll see the new Aaron Paul ""Need for Speed"" movie is if he drives high on meth into a Los Pollos Hermanos.‚Äù"
You could literally show me a clip from any Fast and Furious movie, tell me it was Need For Speed, and I would not know the difference.
@Curlseiby he's in the need for speed movie lol and has. A bunch of movies coming out this year and next
Need for speed been my game since ps2 days...but it cant compete with the fast &amp; furious series as a movie franchise.
Need For Speed just gives me the impression that it's just a poor Fast and Furious movie. Which is saying something.
Usos win the titles in a clean match. Nice. Then a trailer for the Need for Speed movie is shown. Wait a minute. What?
They did a wonderful job of fitting in the key plot elements of the NFS games into the movie: the speed and the inherent need for said speed
I ain't even know my nigga Kid cudi was in the new need for speed movie !
I find it funny and genius that Kid Cudi is a helicopter pilot in the new Need for Speed movie
RT @zazzumplop: Need for Speed looks like a fun movie, but you know the film version of Gran Turismo will be so much more realistic.
Need for Speed may be the stupidest looking movie ever made. Like ever. In my lifetime. Even stupider than that Divas segment. #WWERAW
Need for speed movie? NOPE. Rather would play the games. Celebrities bore the crap out of me. #RawChicago Chicago
Kid Cudi in the Need for Speed movie
HAHA HE'S GOT A NEED FOR SPEED, THAT'S THE NAME OF THE MOVIE, THAT'S SO AWESO- fuck. What a stupid segment, and I like ALL of them. #RAW
I can't wait for the Need for Speed movie...said no one...ever. #WhyDoesItExist
